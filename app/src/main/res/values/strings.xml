    <string name="AndroidHead">Android \n App Development</string>
    <string name="android_text" translatable="false">Android software development is the process by which applications are created
for devices running the Android operating system. Google states that Android apps can be written
using Kotlin,Java,and C++ languages using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK), while using other languages is also
possible. All non-Java virtual machine (JVM) languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly,
need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied by tools,likely with restricted API
support. Some programming languages and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e.for both
Android and iOS).</string>

    <string name="WebHead">Web \nDevelopment</string>
    <string name="web_text" translatable="false">Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet
(World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a
simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and
social network services.

    <string name="AIHead">Artificial Intelligence</string>
    <string name="iOS_text" translatable="false">iOS application development is the process of making mobile applications
for Apple hardware, including iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. The software is written in the Swift
programming language or Objective-C and then deployed to the App Store for users to download.
        Nevertheless, if your organizationâ€™s employees, customers or partners are among the hundreds of
millions of Apple iPhone and iPad users around the world, you have obvious reasons to engage in iOS
app development. And despite potentially high barriers to entry, developing an iOS app can be as
easy as (sometimes easier than) developing for Android. With proper planning and the right
resources, you can join the ranks of iOS app developers.</string>

    <string name="ml_head" translatable="false">Machine Learning</string>
    <string name="ml_text" translatable="false">Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence
concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and
generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Advances in the
field of deep learning have allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in
performance.
    ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech
recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business
problems is known as predictive analytics.
    Statistics and mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods comprise the
foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory
data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.
    From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework
for describing machine learning.</string>
